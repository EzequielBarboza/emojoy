## Push API demo on App Engine

A demo App Engine server using https://w3c.github.io/push-api/ to send push
messages to web browsers.

Currently requires a custom build of Chrome; as browsers land support for the
Push API, this repository will be updated, and should start working with
unmodified builds of Chrome, Firefox, etc.
