## Push API demo on App Engine

A demo App Engine server using https://w3c.github.io/push-api/ to send push
messages to web browsers.

Live version: https://johnme-gcm.appspot.com/chat/

Currently requires Chrome 42+. As other browsers land support for the Push API,
this repository will be updated, and should start working with Firefox etc.

See [requirements.txt][1] for instructions on installing dependencies, if you
want to run your own copy on App Engine.
